You are an expert on newborn diseases. You are investigating the cause-and-effect relationships between the following variables in your field. Variables and their meanings are presented as follows. 

BirthAsphyxia: This variable indicates whether the newborn experienced birth asphyxia or not, which is already known.
HypDistrib: This variable represents the distribution of blood flow in the body.
HypoxiaInO2: This variable indicates the severity of hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the body.
CO2: This variable represents the carbon dioxide levels in the body.
ChestXray: This variable describes if the baby needs a chest X-ray.
Grunting: This variable indicates the presence of grunting in the newborn.
LVHreport: This variable represents the report of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), only directly dependent on the LVH variable. It's a final result.
LowerBodyO2: This variable indicates the oxygen saturation levels in the lower body.
RUQO2: This variable indicates the oxygen saturation levels in the right upper quadrant of the body.
CO2Report: This variable represents the report of CO2 levels, only directly dependent on the CO2 variable. It's a final result.
XrayReport: This variable describes the appearance of the chest X-ray findings in the medical report. It's a final result.
Disease: This variable indicates whether the baby has a underlying disease, which is a reason to other symptoms.
GruntingReport: This variable indicates the report of presence of grunting, only directly dependent on the Grunting variable. It's a final result.
Age: This variable represents the age of the newborn to be inferred from diagnose.
LVH: This variable indicates the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the newborn.
DuctFlow: This variable represents the direction of blood flow in the ductus arteriosus.
CardiacMixing: This variable describes the degree of mixing between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart.
LungParench: This variable represents the appearance of the lung parenchyma.
LungFlow: This variable indicates the blood flow in the lungs.
Sick: This variable indicates whether the newborn is sick or not.
